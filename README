Project: 2
Title: UNIX Password Implementation and Rainbow Table Attack

Group members:
Cameron Nieters,
Connor Cloutier,
Anuska Shrestha,
Abhishek Adhikari

Dependencies: libcrypt

To compile: `make`

To build the table: `build-table [OPTIONS] dict_file`
To view the user manual for `build-table`: `man -l build-table.1`

To use the password cracker: `crack`
Due to the lack of an MD5crypt implementation from the other group members,
the password cracker produces the hash to be cracked instead of pulling from a
file.
